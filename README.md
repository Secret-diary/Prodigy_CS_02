## Overview

The provided Python program implements a simple image encryption and decryption tool using basic pixel manipulation techniques. The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by performing operations such as swapping pixel values.


## Requirements

Python: The program is written in Python, so you'll need a Python interpreter installed on your system.

Pillow (Python Imaging Library - Fork): Pillow is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), which adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

                 pip install Pillow

## Usage

1. To run the code:

     https://github.com/Secret-diary/Prodigy_CS_02.git

2. Navigate to the directory

3. Run the Program
            python3 Prodigy_cs_02.py


## Example

Enter the path to the image: <path>
Enter the operation (swap/multiply): multiply
Enter the key (integer): 5
Image encrypted successfully
Image decrypted successfully
